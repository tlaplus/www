TLA+ is a language for modeling software above the code level and
hardware above the circuit level.&nbsp; It has an IDE (Integrated
Development Environment) for writing models and running tools to check
them.&nbsp; The tool most commonly used by engineers is the TLC model
checker, but there is also a proof checker.&nbsp; TLA+ is based on
mathematics and does not resemble any programming language.&nbsp;
Most engineers will find PlusCal, described below, to be the easiest way to
start using TLA+.

TLA+ models are usually called <em>specifications</em>.&nbsp;  They are called

PlusCal is a language for writing algorithms&mdash;especially
concurrent and distributed ones.&nbsp; It is meant to replace
pseudocode with precise, testable code.&nbsp; PlusCal looks like a
simple toy programming language, but with constructs for describing
concurrency and nondeterminacy.&nbsp; It is infinitely more expressive
than any programming language because any mathematical formula can be
used as a PlusCal expression.&nbsp; 
A PlusCal algorithm is translated into a
TLA+ model that can be checked with the TLA+ tools.&nbsp;
Because it looks like a programming language, most engineers find PlusCal
easier to learn than TLA+.&nbsp; But because it looks like a
programming language, PlusCal cannot structure complex models as well as
TLA+ can.

Computers and computer networks are physical objects whose behaviors
are described by continuous physical laws.&nbsp;  They differ from most
other kinds of physical objects in that their behaviors are naturally 
modeled as sets of discrete events.&nbsp;  Programming, software
engineering, and most of computer science is concerned with models in
which a behavior of a system is described as a set of discrete events.
No model is a completely accurate description of a real system.&nbsp;
A model is a description of some aspect of the system, written for
some purpose.&nbsp;  

<!--
   We all use one or more ways of modeling the behavior of a computer
   systems as a set of discrete events.&nbsp; Often, people think their
   model is the actual system, not just a model of it.&nbsp; When
   presented with a different model, they may think it's wrong or perhaps
   just incomplete because it doesn't describe things that are in their
   model.&nbsp; No model is a completely accurate description of a real
   system.&nbsp; A model should be judged not by how accurate it is, but
   by how useful it is; and that depends on what you're using it for.
-->


<p> 


TLA+ is state-based, meaning that it models an execution of a system
as a sequence of states, where an event is represented by a pair of
consecutive states.&nbsp; We call a sequence of states a
<em>behavior</em>; and we call a pair of consecutive states a
<em>step</em> rather than an event.&nbsp;
A system is modeled as the set of behaviors describing all of its
possible executions.

    Modeling Above the Code Level

<DIV id="above-code" class="hidden-div"> <!-- style="display:bloxk"-->


TLA+ is used to model systems above the code level.&nbsp;

To see what this, means consider Euclid's algorithm for computing
<nobr>&thinsp;<code>GCD(M,N)</code>&thinsp;,</nobr> the greatest
common divisor of two positive integers &thinsp;<code>M</code>&thinsp;
and &thinsp;<code>N</code>&nbsp;.  Here is the algorithm:

<UL>
<LI> 
   Let &thinsp;<code>x</code>&thinsp; equal
   &thinsp;<code>M</code>&thinsp; and &thinsp;<code>y</code>&thinsp;
   equal &thinsp;<code>N</code>&thinsp;.
</LI>

<LI  style="margin-top:7px"> 
   Repeated subtract the smaller of &thinsp;<code>x</code>&thinsp; and
   &thinsp;<code>y</code>&thinsp; from the larger.
</LI>

<LI  style="margin-top:7px"> 
   Stop when &thinsp;<code>x</code>&thinsp; and
   &thinsp;<code>y</code>&thinsp; have the same value.  That value is the
   GCD of &thinsp;<code>M</code>&thinsp; and
   &thinsp;<code>N</code>&thinsp;.
</LI>
</UL>

This description is above the code level.&nbsp;

Code to compute <nobr>&thinsp;<code>GCD(M,N)</code>&thinsp;</nobr>
would have to specify additional details such as the type of
&thinsp;<code>M</code>&thinsp; and &thinsp;<code>N</code>&thinsp; (is
it &thinsp;<code>int</code>?
&thinsp;<code>long</code>?
&thinsp;<code>BigInteger</code>?)  and what to do if
&thinsp;<code>M</code>&thinsp; or &thinsp;<code>N</code>&thinsp; is
not positive (throw an exception?  return an error value?).  <p>

A programmer who didn't know Euclid's algorithm might decide to compute 
 <nobr>&thinsp;<code>GCD(M,N)</code>&thinsp;</nobr> 
by a naive algorithm that sets &thinsp;<code>x</code>&thinsp; to the
minimum of &thinsp;<code>M</code>&thinsp; and
&thinsp;<code>N</code>&thinsp; and keeps decreasing
&thinsp;<code>x</code>&thinsp; until it divides both
&thinsp;<code>M</code>&thinsp; and
&thinsp;<code>N</code>&thinsp;.&nbsp; The best coder in the world will
not produce a good GCD program by coding the naive algorithm.&nbsp;
Moreover, thinking in terms of code makes it harder for a programmer
to find a better algorithm.&nbsp; Finding a good algorithm requires
thinking above the code level.

 <p>


No one writes a piece of code without first having a high-level model
of what the code should do and how it should do it.&nbsp; A programmer
never starts by deciding to declare some variables, adding a
&thinsp;<b>while</b>&thinsp; statement, then adding an
&thinsp;<b>if</b>&thinsp; statement, and so on&mdash;only discovering
when finished that she's written a sorting program.&nbsp; But
programmers rarely start with a <em>precise</em> model of the code.
Having only a vague, incomplete model leads to basic design errors
that the best coding won't correct.  <p>

<p> 
TLA+ is a language for writing precise high-level models of what
code does and how it does it.&nbsp;  

 <!-- 
   It looks nothing like a programming language because programming
   languages are designed for writing code, not for thinking above the
   code level.&nbsp; Instead, TLA+ is based on mathematics, the universal
   language of science and engineering.
 -->


Most programmers believe that precise models are good only for
tiny well-defined problems like computing the GCD, but are useless for
implementing complex systems.&nbsp;  They're wrong.&nbsp;  The more
complex a system is, the more important it is to make it as simple as
possible.&nbsp;  In complex systems, simplicity isn't achieved by coding
tricks.&nbsp;  It's achieved by rigorous thinking above the code level.

<p>

In 
  <a href="industrial-use2903.html?unhideBut=hide-rtos&amp;unhideDiv=rtos&amp;back-link=high-level-view.html#language?unhideBut@EQhide-above-code@AMPunhideDiv@EQabove-code">
     one industrial project</a>,
starting with a TLA+ model reduced the size of a real-time
operating system's code by a factor of ten.&nbsp;
Such a reduction in
code size isn't obtained by better coding; it comes from thinking
rigorously above the code level. 

 <p>

Writing a model above the code level doesn't prevent coding
errors.&nbsp; Many methods and tools have been developed for finding
coding errors, and they should be used.&nbsp; But they are not good
for finding errors in the high-level model from which the code is
derived.&nbsp; And it's impossible to test that a high-level model is
implemented correctly if the model is just a vague idea in the
programmer's mind, with no precise description.

<p>

Testing the code is not an effective way to find fundamental design
errors&mdash;especially in concurrent and distributed systems.&nbsp;
Moreover, a design error found after the code has been written is
usually fixed with an <em>ad hoc</em> patch that is unlikely to
eliminate all instances of the problem and is likely to introduce new
errors.&nbsp; Design errors should be caught by writing a precise
high-level model, before the code is written.

A distributed system is a concurrent system in which we
think of the processes as being spatially separated, usually communicating
with one other by sending messages.

In a state-based model, a state represents the entire physical state
of a system.&nbsp; Some people find it hard to believe that one can or
should model a distributed system in terms of a single global
state.&nbsp; Over 40 years of experience has taught me that this is
the most generally useful way to model distributed algorithms and
systems.

Like many state-based methods, TLA+ describes a set of
behaviors with two things:

<ol > <li> An <em>initial condition</em> that specifies the 
        possible starting states.</li> 

     <li style="margin-top:7px">A <em>next-state relation</em> that
        specifies the possible steps (pairs of successive states). </li>
</ol>

They specify the set of behaviors whose first state satisfies the
initial condition and whose every step 
satisfies the next-state relation.&nbsp;

<p>

This kind of model is often called a <em>state machine</em>.&nbsp; (A
finite-state machine is a state machine with a finite set of possible
states.&nbsp; Finite-state machines are not nearly as useful as
general state machines.)&nbsp; A Turing machine is an example of a
state machine.&nbsp; In a deterministic Turing machine, the next-state
relation allows at most one next state for any state, and it allows no
next state for a terminating state.&nbsp;

<p>

The simplest and most practical method of precisely describing the
semantics of a programming language, called operational semantics,
essentially consists of showing how to <q>compile</q> a program in the
language to a state machine.&nbsp; Given an operational semantics, any
program in the language can be viewed as a state machine.&nbsp; I
suspect that most programmers intuitively think of a program in that
way.

<p> The next-state action specifies what steps <em>may</em> happen; it
doesn't specify what steps, if any, <em>must</em> happen.&nbsp; That
requires an additional condition, called a <em>fairness</em>
property.&nbsp; A state machine that models a sequential program
usually includes the fairness property that some step must be taken
(the behavior must not stop) if the next-state relation allows a step
to be taken.&nbsp; Models of concurrent and distributed programs often
have more complicated fairness properties.



<!--
Most people find it natural to consider an initial condition and
next-state relation to describe only behaviors that cannot end in a
state in which there exists a possible next state.&nbsp; This is fine
for modeling sequential systems, but not concurrent ones.&nbsp; For
example, it's not a natural way of modeling a client-server system in
which clients can stop sending requests.&nbsp; TLA+ considers the
next-state relation to describe what steps are allowed to happen, but
to say nothing about what steps must happen.&nbsp; For example, it
never rules out a behavior that stops in its initial state.&nbsp; What
steps must happen are described by an additional
condition&mdash;usually what is called a <em>fairness</em>
condition.&nbsp; That a behavior doesn't stop in a state from which
the next-state relation allows a step is a fairness condition.
-->

<p>

A state-machine model without a fairness condition can be used to
catch errors of <q>commision</q>, in which the system does something
wrong.&nbsp; It can't be used to catch errors of <q>omission</q>, in
which the system fails to do something.&nbsp; In practice, errors of
commission are more numerous and harder to find than errors of
omission.&nbsp; Often, engineers don't bother adding fairness
conditions.&nbsp; Therefore, you should first learn to write the
initial condition and next-state relation in your TLA+ models.&nbsp;
Later, you can learn to write fairness conditions.

<DIV id="checking" class="hidden-div"> <!-- style="display:none"-->

One reason for modeling a system is to check if it does what we want
it to.&nbsp; We do that by checking if the model satisfies properties
that we believe assert that the system does what it should.&nbsp; TLA+
can assert, and its tools can check, only that some property of an
individual behavior is true of every possible behavior of the
model.&nbsp; Thus, TLA+ cannot assert that 99% of all possible
behaviors terminate in a correct state.&nbsp; However, it can assert
(and its tools can check) that every possible behavior terminates in a
correct state if its initial state belongs to a particular set
containing 99% of all possible initial states.


<p> 

The most useful type of property to check is an invariance property,
which asserts that something is true of every state of every possible
behavior.&nbsp; Often, an engineer will check only invariance
properties of a model.

<p>

For a model containing a fairness condition, you should also check
simple properties asserting that something eventually happens&mdash;for
example, that every execution eventually halts.&nbsp;  Those properties,
called <em>liveness properties</em>, are easily expressed in TLA+.

<p>


The rich variety of properties that we want to check for concurrent
systems can't all be expressed as invariance and simple liveness
properties.&nbsp;  They can be expressed as state machines (possibly with
fairness conditions).&nbsp;  

A state machine can be viewed as the property that is satisfied by the
possible behaviors of the state machine.&nbsp; We can check whether
another state machine satisfies this property.&nbsp; If it does, we
say that the other state machine <em>implements</em> the state
machine.


<p>

In TLA+ there is no formal distinction between a state machine and a
property.&nbsp;  Both are described by mathematical formulas.&nbsp;  

A state machine is a formula having a particular <q>shape</q>, 
different from the shape of an invariance or liveness property.&nbsp;


Both <em>satisfying a property</em> and <em>implementing a state
machine</em> mean that one formula implies another.


<p>


Today, most engineers check only invariance properties and simple
liveness properties.&nbsp;

However, even if you never do it, knowing how it is done explains
what it means for a program to implement a model, which can help you
avoid making errors in your code.&nbsp;

TLA+ is based on mathematics and does not resemble a programming

languages, but not with precise mathematical notation.&nbsp; We
naturally find what we're familiar with to be simpler than anything
else.&nbsp; It's hard for me to believe that English is not inherently
simpler than German.&nbsp; Upon first seeing a TLA+ model, some
engineers find TLA+ intimidating.&nbsp;  Read the

      Industrial Use of TLA+</a> 
page to see that TLA+ is not very hard to learn.

<p>

Using TLA+ teaches you that math is inherently more expressive than
programming languages because it can describe a value without having
to describe how the value is computed.&nbsp; For example, it can
describe the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers as the
largest positive integer that divides both numbers.&nbsp; This makes
it possible to write a model for a specific purpose, abstracting away
irrelevant details such as how to calculate the GCD.&nbsp; (Putting
code in a procedure doesn't abstract it away;&nbsp; it just makes you
go elsewhere to read the code, requiring that you understand the
semantics of procedure call as well as the code.)&nbsp;

<p>

Starting with PlusCal provides a gentle entry to TLA+.  Even if you
know TLA+, it's easier to write some models in PlusCal rather
than directly in TLA+.  But to get the full benefit of thinking
mathematically above the code level, you should learn TLA+.

<!-- 
<p>

Since the work of Floyd and Hoare in the late 1960s, it has been
generally agreed that the behavior of a sequential programs is best
thought of as a sequence of states, and we should think of a step of a
program as a state-changing event.&nbsp;  I have found this to be true of
concurrent and distributed systems as well.&nbsp;  States are important
because what a system does in the future is controlled by its current
state, not by what happened in the past.

<p>



<hr>


Some methods, including TLA+, have a way of hiding part of the state.
They can describe a system as behaving <em>as if</em> that hidden
state exists, but it needn't actually exist.&nbsp;  There is little
practical benefit in doing this.&nbsp;  Understanding the system requires
understanding the complete state, including its hidden part.&nbsp;  In
practice, it suffices to simply say in a comment that a certain part
of the state need not actually be implemented.
-->


  <!-- 
   Some other methods model a behavior as a sequence of actions.&nbsp;
   The ones that are comparable to TLA+ in terms of their utility employ
   a sequence of states to control the order in which actions can occur,
   the current state determining which actions are possible and the
   action determining the next state.&nbsp; Adding named actions to the
   state changes would add nothing to the usefulness of TLA+.  <p>
  -->

 <!--
   Rarely can we say that one model is better than
   another.&nbsp; We can at most say that one is more useful than another
   for a certain purpose.&nbsp;
 -->

 <!--
   I've found that for most engineering uses, the behavior of a system
   can be modeled as a sequence of events.&nbsp;  If two events represent
   concurrent operations in different processes, the model will allow
   behaviors in which the events occur in either order.&nbsp;
